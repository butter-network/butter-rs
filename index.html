<p>There is a distinction between getting information when you known exactly what you are looking for (searching for something by a unique name/id) vs searching for something more generally i.e. search engine (both use search algorithms)</p>
<h2 id="the-platform-vocabulary">The platform vocabulary</h2>
<p>This is an aggregation of all the common terminology that may be required when discussing decentralised systems.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A ’server’ becomes a ’listener’</p></li>
<li><p>A ’client’ becomes a ’caller’</p></li>
<li><p>A node is an entity on the network that can both call and listen (expressed as a vertec)</p></li>
<li><p>A peer is a node connected to other nodes on the network (expressed as a vertex with at least one connection)</p></li>
<li><p>Peers are two or more connected nodes</p></li>
<li><p>Each peer has a list of known peers</p></li>
<li><p>A first-degree peer is one that a peer has in his list (expreesed as as edge)</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="an-informal-analogy">An informal analogy</h2>
<p>This is used to improve reasoning and creative thinking about decentralised systems.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A person can be thout of as a node (a unit of communication that can both listen and communicate information)</p></li>
<li><p>A friend...</p></li>
