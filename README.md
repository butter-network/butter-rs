## Brief project overview

How am I building my decentralised platform/framework

Please see the full project documentation here: 

## Workflow
### Using the platform/library
### Developing
- see the project board
- raise an issue
### Testing the platform on a network locally
We want to be testing with different IPs (at least on the local network). We can use containers to have several IPs and test the system.

To open an interactive shell 
```bash
docker-compose run node bash
```
